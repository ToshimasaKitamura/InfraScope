# InfraScope

> AI-powered disaster & infrastructure visualization dashboard leveraging Japanese public data via MCP.

## Overview

**InfraScope** is a mock project for a disaster and infrastructure visualization dashboard powered by Japanese public data.

The project aims to integrate open government data — such as datasets provided by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) — via Model Context Protocol (MCP), and present them through an intuitive, map-based interface.

InfraScope explores how public data + LLMs can support faster and clearer situational awareness during disasters.

## 💡 Vision

InfraScope is not just a map application.

It is designed as a digital **Situation Room**:

> Transforming public data into actionable insight — from data to decision.

Future potential includes expansion into a B2B SaaS solution for municipalities, construction companies, logistics operators, and infrastructure stakeholders.
